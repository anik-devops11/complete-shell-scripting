## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Introduction to Shell Scripting

### What is a Shell Script?
A shell script is a text file (`.sh`) that includes a sequence of commands that will be executed by a shell (like Bash). Shell scripts allows for automation that enables one to create reusable, executable programs for tasks that would require manual command-line work.

### Why Shell Scripts?
- üîÑ **Automation**: Tasks that are repetitive, like backups, cleanups and deployments can be fully automated.
- ‚úÖ **Reliability**: You run the same commands, in the same order every time, so you always get the same result. Loss of human error.
- ‚ö° **Efficiency**: You can combine and chain commands to build complex workflows utilizing super simple tools.
- üåê **Native & Lightweight**: Shells are installed in every Unix/Linux system and have no dependencies.
- üõ†Ô∏è **DevOps Basic**: Shell scripts are the core of any administrative tasks, monitoring and automation of infrastructure.
